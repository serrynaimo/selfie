How to use it
-------------

1.  You need a WebRTC enabled browsers and devices. This can be Chrome on Android or Chrome and Firefox on Mac and Windows. With our [Temasys WebRTC Plugin](https://temasys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TWPP/WebRTC+Plugins) you can even use IE or Safari. No iOS just yet :( Sorry.

2.  Make sure both devices are connected to the internet through the same internet connection. For example: Connecting your laptop or second Android phone through tethering with your photo-phone works just fine.

3.  Open the [Photo Capturer](http://serrynaimo.github.io/selfie/phone.html) on the device you want to take the selfies with.

4.  Open the [Selfie Remote Control Dashboard](http://serrynaimo.github.io/selfie) on any other compatible device to trigger the photos.

5.  Have fun :) You can save the captured images with a right click or long press on Android. Don't forget to add a ".jpg" to the filename.
